# SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK

##SiEPIC EBeam PDK, Library

##Package for KLayout, klayout.de

###by Lukas Chrostowski, (c) 2015

###Developed on KLayout version 0.24.3, OSX.

##Package includes:

- PCells: ring resonator; test structure layout with grating couplers and instantiating the ring resonator
- Script / Macro to create a layout via script, including waveguide generation functions
- GDS Library, updated with marker layers for the verification/netlist generation.
- Verification and Netlist generation: 
 - Scanning the layout. Finding waveguides, devices, pins.  
 - Verification: Identifying if there are missing connections, mismatched waveguides, too few points in a bend, etc. 
 - Creating a Spice netlist suitable for importing into Lumerical INTERCONNECT for circuit simulations. Including waveguide length (wg_length) for all waveguides
 - Example layout using the library for verification.



This is posted on GitHub for 1) revision control, 2) so that others can contribute to it, find bugs, 3) easy download of the latest version.

##Installation instructions:

 - The files in the klayout_dot_config folder go into your KLayout configuration folder. On Linux and OSX, this is $HOME/.klayout
 - I donâ€™t know what the equivalent is on windows. 
 - Alternatively, you can import all the files one by one using the KLayout IDE.

I am personally using GitHub desktop to synchronize my files. Then I created symbolic links in my .klayout folder to point to the local copy of this repository.
