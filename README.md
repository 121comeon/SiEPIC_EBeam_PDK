- <a href="www.siepic.ubc.ca">SiEPIC</a> EBeam PDK, Library - for silicon photonics layout, design and verification
- by Lukas Chrostowski, (c) 2015
- Package for KLayout, klayout.de (developed on KLayout version 0.24.3, OSX)
- Instruction on design, layout, fabrication, test, data analysis for silicon photonics provided in the edX course: <a href="edx.org/course/silicon-photonics-design-fabrication-ubcx-phot1x">Silicon Photonics Design, Fabrication and Data Analysis</a> and textbook <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/engineering/electronic-optoelectronic-devices-and-nanotechnology/silicon-photonics-design-devices-systems">Silicon Photonics Design: From Devices to Systems</a> by Lukas Chrostowski and Michael Hochberg.

##Objectives:
 - Use open-source layout tool (KLayout) to implement a sophisticated layout design environment for silicon photonics
 - Support for both GUI and script-based layout, or combinations of both.
 - Whereas a typical schematic-driven design flow includes a schematic, circuit simulation, layout, and verification, the approach taken here is Layout-driven, followed by verification, then a schematic (via a netlist) and simulations.

##Package includes:

- PCells: ring resonator; test structure layout with grating couplers and instantiating the ring resonator
- Script / Macro to create a layout via script, including waveguide generation functions
- GDS Library, updated with marker layers for the verification/netlist generation.
- Verification and Netlist generation: 
 - Scanning the layout. Finding waveguides, devices, pins.  
 - Verification: Identifying if there are missing connections, mismatched waveguides, too few points in a bend, etc. 
 - Creating a Spice netlist suitable for importing into Lumerical INTERCONNECT for circuit simulations. Including waveguide length (wg_length) for all waveguides
- Example layout using the library for verification.
- Layer definition

## Download:

<a href="https://github.com/lukasc-ubc/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK/archive/master.zip">Zip file download of the PDK</a>

This is posted on GitHub for 1) revision control, 2) so that others can contribute to it, find bugs, 3) easy download of the latest version.

##Installation instructions:

 - The files in the klayout_dot_config folder go into your KLayout configuration folder. On Linux and OSX, this is $HOME/.klayout
 - I donâ€™t know what the equivalent is on windows. 
 - Alternatively, you can import all the files one by one using the KLayout IDE.  How to use the <a href = http://www.klayout.de/doc/about/macro_editor.html>KLayout Python IDE for writing/debugging PCells/scripts/macros</a>.

I am personally using GitHub desktop to synchronize my files. Then I created symbolic links in my .klayout folder to point to the local copy of this repository.
